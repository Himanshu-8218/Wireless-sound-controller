Controlling sound level with hand detection

This project aims to develop a wireless sound controller that uses hand detection technology to control audio devices. The system interprets hand gestures to perform various actions such as play, pause, volume up, volume down, and track change.

Features
Hand Detection: Uses computer vision to detect and interpret hand gestures.
Wireless Control: Connects to audio devices wirelessly.
Intuitive Interface: Provides an easy-to-use, contactless interface for controlling audio.


Hardware:

Camera (for hand detection)
Microcontroller or computer
Software:

Python
OpenCV
MediaPipe
